Guess the Number Game
This is a Java-based console game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). The game provides feedback to the user based on their guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The user continues to guess until they get the right answer or run out of attempts.

Features:
Random Number Generation: A random number is generated within a given range (e.g., 1 to 100).
User Input: The user is prompted to guess the generated number.
Feedback: After each guess, feedback is provided to the user:
"Too high" if the guess is greater than the number.
"Too low" if the guess is less than the number.
"Correct" when the guess matches the number.
Limited Attempts: The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
Multiple Rounds: The user has the option to play multiple rounds.
Score Tracking: The game tracks the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or the rounds won.
How to Play:
The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.
After each incorrect guess, the player receives feedback and can guess again.
If the player fails to guess the correct number within the set attempts, they lose the round.
The player can choose to play additional rounds and try to improve their score.
